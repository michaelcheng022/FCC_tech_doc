## [FCC Technical Documentation Page](https://michaelcheng022.github.io/fcc-tech-doc/)
Part of the front-end practice projects for FreeCodeCamp to create a technical documentation page. 
For this project I chose to document how to effectively use the CSS Grid property. 

This project taught me what goes into building a documentation page and how to effectively organize one.

## Features
* Fully responsive web page
